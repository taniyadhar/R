This project is part of my Healthcare Analytics course.
For this project, I used a dataset provided by a health insurance company called Humana. On average, 130 Americans die every day from an opioid overdose. the goal was to identify members at risk who were continuing these medicines after 6 months. I created this predictive model for decreasing insurance company related costs. Using opioids for six months, which is considered long-term opioid therapy (LTOT), considerably increases a patient’s risk of opioid addiction. 1 in 4 patients receiving LTOT will struggle with opioid addiction. Being able to identify these patients will allow for early intervention and a decrease in cost to health insurance companies, as opioid addiction leads to increased use of resources. In addition, our predictive model is geared towards insurance companies for cost savings.
